-- TripBrain storage policies
-- Run AFTER 001_init.sql. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor and Run.
--
-- The `trip-uploads` bucket is private. Without explicit policies, neither the
-- anon key (browser) nor the service role (server) can insert / read objects
-- there, which breaks Setup step 5 uploads and the ingestion pipeline.
--
-- Scope: because the TripBrain MVP has no auth, we allow anon + authenticated to
-- insert and select within this one bucket. The security boundary is the
-- unguessable trip_id in the URL (matches the app's overall model per
-- BUILD_SPEC §5 / RLS-disabled stance).

-- idempotent — drop old policies first so re-running this file is safe
